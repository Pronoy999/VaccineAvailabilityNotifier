# VaccineAvailabilityNotifier

A website where you can be notified if a vaccine is available in your pincode. 

To know whether vaccine is available at your location for your, you needed to check the Co-Win app every time. 
So I just automated that process, you register at our system and we will email you the moment when there is a vaccine.
